        "In this tutorial you will learn how to re-create the Maze2D datasets from [D4RL](https://sites.google.com/view/d4rl/home) [1] with Minari.\nWe will be using the refactored version of the PointMaze environments in [Gymnasium-Robotics](https://robotics.farama.org/envs/maze/point_maze/) which support the Gymnasium API as well as the latest\nMuJoCo python bindings.\n\nLets start by breaking down the steps to generate these datasets:\n  1. First we need to create a planner that outputs a trajectory of waypoints that the agent can follow to reach the goal from its initial location in the maze. We will be using\n     [Q-Value Iteration](https://towardsdatascience.com/fundamental-iterative-methods-of-reinforcement-learning-df8ff078652a) [2] to solve the discrete grid maze, same as in D4RL.\n  2. Then we also need to generate the actions so that the agent can follow the waypoints of the trajectory. For this purpose D4RL implements a PD controller.\n  3. Finally, to create the Minari dataset, we will wrap the environment with a :class:`minari.DataCollector` and step through it by generating actions with the path planner and waypoint controller.\n\nFor this tutorial we will be using the ``PointMaze_Medium-v3`` environment to collect transition data. However, any map implementation in the PointMaze environment group can be used.\nAnother important factor to take into account is that the environment is continuing, which means that it won't be ``terminated`` when reaching a goal. Instead a new goal target will be randomly selected and the agent\nwill start from the location it's currently at (no ``env.reset()`` required).\n\nLets start by importing the required modules for this tutorial:\n\n"

        "## WayPoint Planner\nOur first task is to create a method that generates a trajectory to the goal in the maze.\nWe have the advantage that the MuJoCo maze can be discretized into a grid of cells, which reduces\nthe size of the state space. The action space for this solver will also be reduced to ``UP``, ``DOWN``, ``LEFT``,\nand ``RIGHT``. The solution trajectories will then be a set of waypoints that the agent has to follow to reach the\ngoal.\nWe can simply use a variation of Dynamic Programming to generate the trajectories. The method chosen in the D4RL[1] publication\nis that of Value Iteration, specifically Q-Value Iteration[2]. We will obtain the optimal Q-values by doing a series of Bellman\nupdates (``50`` in total) of the form:\n\n\\begin{align}Q'(s, a) \\leftarrow \\sum_{s'}T(s,a,s')[R(s,a,s') + \\gamma\\max_{a'}Q(s',a')]\\end{align}\n\n**T(s,a,s')** is the transition matrix which gives the probability of reaching state **s'** when taking action **a** from state **s**.\nWe consider the grid maze a deterministic space which means that if **s'** is an empty cell **T(s,a,s')** will have a value of ``1`` since\nwe know that the agent will always reach that state. On the other hand, if the state **s'** is a wall the value of **T(s,a,s')** will be ``0``.\n\nOnce we have the optimal Q-values (**Q***) we can generate a waypoint trajectory with the following policy:\n\n\\begin{align}\\pi(s) = arg\\max_{a}Q^{*}(s,a)\\end{align}\n\nThe class below, ``QIteration``, gives access to the method ``generate_path(current_cell, goal_cell)``.  This method returns a dictionary of waypoints\nsuch as:\n\n.. code:: py\n\n  {(5, 1): (4, 1), (4, 1): (4, 2), (4, 2): (3, 2), (3, 2): (2, 2), (2, 2): (2, 1), (2, 1): (1, 1)}\n\nThe keys of this dictionary are the current state of the agent and the values the next state of the wapoint path.\n\n"

        "## Waypoint Controller\nThe step will be to create a controller to allow the agent to follow the waypoint trajectory.\nD4RL uses a PD controller to output continuous force actions from position and velocity.\nA PD controller is a variation of the PID controller often used in classical Control Theory.\nPID combines three components: a Proportial Term(P), Integral Term(I) and Derivative Term (D)\n\n### 1. Proportional Term (P)\nThe proportional term in a PID controller adjusts the control action based on the current error, which\nis the difference between the desired value (setpoint) and the current value of the process variable.\nThe control action is directly proportional to the error. A higher error results in a stronger control action.\nHowever, the proportional term alone can lead to overshooting or instability. Note $\\tau$ is our control value.\n\n.. math ::\n  \\tau = k_{p}(\\text{Error})\n\n### 2. Derivative Term (D)\nThe derivative term in a PD controller considers the rate of change of the error over time.\nIt helps to predict the future behavior of the error. By dampening the control action based\non the rate of change of the error, the derivative term contributes to system stability and reduces overshooting.\nIt also helps the system respond quickly to changes in the error.\n\n.. math ::\n  \\tau = k_{d}(d(\\text{Error}) / dt)\n\nSo for a PD controller we have the equation below. We explain what the values $k_{d}$ and $k_{p}$ mean in a bit\n\n.. math ::\n  \\tau = k_{p}(\\text{Error})  + k_{d}(d(\\text{Error}) / dt)\n\n### 3. Integral Term (I)\nThe integral term in a PID controller integrates the cumulative error over time.\nIt helps to address steady-state errors or biases that may exist in the system.\nThe integral term continuously adjusts the control action based on the accumulated error,\naiming to eliminate any long-term deviations between the desired setpoint and the actual process variable.\n\n.. math ::\n  \\tau = k_{I}{\\int}_0^t(\\text{Error}) dt\n\nFinally for a PID controller we have the equation below\n\n.. math ::\n  \\tau = k_{p}(\\text{Error})  + k_{d}(d(\\text{Error}) / dt) +  k_{I}\\int_{0}^{t}(\\text{Error}) dt\n\nIn the PID controller formula, $K_p$, $K_i$, and $K_d$ are the respective gains for the proportional, integral, and derivative terms.\nThese gains determine the influence of each term on the control action.\nThe optimal values for these gains are typically determined through tuning, which involves adjusting\nthe gains to achieve the desired control performance.\n\nNow back to our controller as stated previously, for the D4RL task we use a PD controller and we\nfollow the same theme as what we have stated before as can be seen below. The $Error$ is equlivalent\nto the difference between the $\\text{goal}_\\text{pose}$ and $\\text{agent}_\\text{pose}$ and we replace the derivative term $(d(\\text{Error}) / dt)$ with\nthe velocity of the the agent $v_{\\text{agent}}$, we can think of this as a measure of the speed at which the agent\nis approaching the target position. When the agent is moving quickly towards the target, the\nderivative term will be larger, contributing to a stronger corrective action from the controller.\nOn the other hand, if the agent is already close to the target and moving slowly, the derivative term will be smaller,\nresulting in a less aggressive control action.\n\n.. math ::\n  \\tau = k_{p}(p_{\\text{goal}} - p_{\\text{agent}}) + k_{d}v_{\\text{agent}}\n\nEach target position in the waypoint trajectory is converted from discrete to a continuous value and we also add some noise to\nthe $x$ and $y$ coordinates to add more variance in the trajectories generated for the offline dataset.\n\n"
